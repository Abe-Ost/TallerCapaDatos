# TallerCapaDatos
This project aims to build a robust and organized expense management system using a three-tier architecture (API, BLL, DAL). A database context will be created that will define key entities (User, Expense, Category, Currency, Budget) and their relationships. For data manipulation, entity-specific repositories will be implemented.
